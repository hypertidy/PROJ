Description: A wrapper around the generic coordinate transformation software 'PROJ'
  that transforms geospatial coordinates from one coordinate reference system ('CRS') 
  to another. This includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations. 
  Version 7.1.0-1 or higher of the R package 'libproj' is required. The intention is for this 
  package to be used by user-packages such as 'reproj', and that the older 'PROJ.4' and version 5 
  pathways be provided by the 'proj4' package. Separating this disruptive version
  change (from 4.0 and 5.0, to 6.0 and above) allows the use of existing and 
  stable code in 'proj4' alongside the new idioms and requirements of modern 'PROJ'. For control
  of metadata files for the 'PROJ' library, see tools in the 'libproj' package.
